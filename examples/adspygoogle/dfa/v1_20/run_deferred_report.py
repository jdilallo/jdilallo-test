"""This example requests the generation of a report. Once the report has been
requested, you can continually get updates on the status of the report until it
is completed. There is currently no way to get a query ID through the DFA API;
you must use the website interface or the Java DART API instead. To request an
update on a report's status, run get_report.py.
