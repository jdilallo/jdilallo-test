This directory contains demo programs that show how to use the client library.

The demo programs are on purpose written differently, to highlight various ways
of performing similar tasks (i.e. initiating DfaClient object, reading auth info
from a pickle, setting auth and config info at DfaClient initialization, etc.).

For additional examples, see unittests in "../../../tests/".
