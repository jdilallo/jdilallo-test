"""This code example creates new line item creative associations (LICAs) for an
existing line item and a set of creative ids. For small business networks,
the creative ids must represent new or copied creatives as creatives cannot be
used for more than one line item. For premium solution networks, the reative ids
can represent any creatvie. To copy creatives, run copy_image_creatives.py. To
determine which LICAs exist, run get_all_licas.py."""
