This directory contains demo programs that show how to use the client library.

The demo programs are on purpose written differently, to highlight various ways
of performing similar tasks (i.e. initiating Client object, reading auth info
from a pickle, setting auth and config info at Client initialization, etc.).

For additional examples, see unittests in "../tests/".
