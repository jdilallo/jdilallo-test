"""This example demonstrates how to authenticate using OAuth2.

This example is intended for users who wish to use the oauth2client library
directly. Using a workflow similar to the example here, you can take advantage
of the oauth2client in a broader range of contexts than caching your refresh
token using the config.py scripts allows.

You can avoid having to use the oauth2client library directly by using the Ads
Python Client Library's config.py script to cache a client ID, client secret,
and refresh token for reuse.

This example is intended to be run from the command line as it takes user input.
