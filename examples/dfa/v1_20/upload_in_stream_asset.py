"""Uploads an In-Stream video asset into an existing In-Stream video creative.

To create an In-Stream video creative, run create_in_stream_video_creative.py.

This example creates a media file in the target creative because the
'mediaFile' flag on the InStreamAssetUploadRequest was set to 'true'. You can
use the same workflow to upload companion ads or non-linear ads to your creative
by setting the 'companion' or 'nonLinear' flags instead, respectively. Only one
flag may be set per upload request.
