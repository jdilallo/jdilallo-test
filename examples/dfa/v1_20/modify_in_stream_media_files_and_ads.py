"""Modifies the media assets associated with an In-Stream video creative.

You are not given the opportunity to set the fields on these components when
they are created by uploading creative assets. Therefore, you must upload the
assets first and then set any additional fields in a second request.

To create an In-Stream video creative, run create_in_stream_video_creative.py.
To add an In-Stream asset to an In-Stream video creative, run
upload_in_stream_asset.py.
